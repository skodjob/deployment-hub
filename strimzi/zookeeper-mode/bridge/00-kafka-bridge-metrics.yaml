spec:
  replicas: 1 # TLDR; running more replicas is not recommended
  # HTTP clients must maintain affinity to the same instance of the Kafka Bridge to access any consumers or subscriptions
  # that they create. Hence, running multiple replicas of the Kafka Bridge per Kubernetes Deployment is not recommended.
  # If the Kafka Bridge pod restarts (for instance, due to Kubernetes relocating the workload to another node),
  # the HTTP client must recreate any consumers or subscriptions.
